This file provides installation instructions, a sample test run and
a list of the files the project with a brief description for each one.


Installation
============

To install MatchingTools using pip do

  pip install matchingtools

To install MatchingTools from a local copy of the project open a terminal
in the top level directory and type

  python setup.py install

  
Documentation
=============

A documentation with some examples and a detailed description of the
modules in the library is at: http://matchingtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.
Inside a local copy of the project, it can be generated by running

  make html

in the doc directory. It will appear in doc/_build/html (the starting
point is index.html)


Sample test runs
================

To test that MatchingTools is working correctly, you can run the script
examples/simple_example.py. It should produce a text file named
"simple_example_results.txt" with the following content

  Collected:
    O1phi:
      2 (MXi^(-4)) kappa kappa
  
    O3phi:
      -1 (MXi^(-4)) kappa kappa
  
    ODphi:
      1/2 (MXi^(-4)) kappa kappa
  
    ODphic:
      1/2 (MXi^(-4)) kappa kappa
  
    Ophi4:
      1/2 (MXi^(-2)) kappa kappa
  
    Ophi6:
      -1 (MXi^(-4)) lamb kappa kappa
  
  Rest:

Similarly, the script "extras_example.py" should produce the
following output:

  Collected:
    O1phid:
      -1/2 (MDY^(-2))(14) lambdaDYd(14,-2) lambdaDYdc(14,-1)
  
    O1phidc:
      -1/2 (MDY^(-2))(14) lambdaDYdc(14,-2) lambdaDYd(14,-1)
  
    O1phiq:
      (-0.25+0j) (MD^(-2))(0) lambdaDq(0,-2) lambdaDqc(0,-1)
  
    O1phiqc:
      (-0.25+0j) (MD^(-2))(0) lambdaDqc(0,-2) lambdaDq(0,-1)
  
    O3phiq:
      (-0.25+0j) (MD^(-2))(0) lambdaDq(0,-2) lambdaDqc(0,-1)
  
    O3phiqc:
      (-0.25+0j) (MD^(-2))(0) lambdaDqc(0,-2) lambdaDq(0,-1)
  
    Odphi:
      1/2 (MD^(-2))(0) yd(10,-2) lambdaDqc(0,-1) lambdaDq(0,10)
      -1 (MD^(-1))(15) (MDY^(-1))(14) lambdaDYDc(14,15) lambdaDqc(15,-1) lambdaDYd(14,-2)
      1/2 (MDY^(-2))(14) yd(-1,26) lambdaDYd(14,-2) lambdaDYdc(14,26)
  
    Odphic:
      1/2 (MD^(-2))(0) ydc(10,-2) lambdaDq(0,-1) lambdaDqc(0,10)
      -1 (MDY^(-1))(18) (MD^(-1))(19) lambdaDYD(18,19) lambdaDYdc(18,-2) lambdaDq(19,-1)
      1/2 (MDY^(-2))(14) ydc(-1,26) lambdaDYdc(14,-2) lambdaDYd(14,26)
