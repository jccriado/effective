`efttools` revolves around the manipulation of tensors, which are objects
of the class :class:`efttools.algebra.Tensor`. Every kind of object that appears
inside a lagrangian including fields, coupling constants, structure constants,
numeric coefficients and masses can be represented by an instance of this class.

.. autoclass:: efttools.algebra.Tensor

Direct usage of the ``Tensor`` constructor obscures the code. Two classes
are defined to make the process of creating tensors easier and cleaner,
:class:`efttools.algebra.TensorBuilder` and
:class:`efttools.algebra.FieldBuilder`.

.. autoclass:: efttools.algebra.TensorBuilder
   :members: __call__

.. autoclass:: efttools.algebra.FieldBuilder
   :members: __call__
